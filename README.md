Abstract

The following dataset is based on health insurance where a set of people with different age, height,gender, and region were asked to give the information about their healthcare expenses. This sectiondetails how these variables (age, gender, BMI, etc.) have affected their medical insurance charges

Health insurance dataset 

Project key points 
The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to predict and quantify the overall medical charges by determining how various factors contribute to the final cost. This is achieved by first identifying the impact of specific behavioral and biological characteristics, such as the individual's Smoker status and BMI, on their health condition and, consequently, their expenses. Simultaneously, analysis must focus on assessing the influence of key demographic and socioeconomic variables, including Age, Sex, number of Children, and Region, to understand their correlation with medical spending.

In short 

the goal is to use these insights—derived from comparative analysis across different groups—to develop data-driven models that inform risk management, aid in setting fair insurance premiums, and guide targeted public health or healthcare intervention strategies.
